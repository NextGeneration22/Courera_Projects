            I am a self-tauth who teach himself full stack developer for both application and presentation layers, and I'm cerreunty taking courses from IBM on coursera, hopefully I can get certificate to show my case.
            I think the only thing I need is to becomme comfident of my skills because I think I'm going to fail in the interview, but I don't think they have a course for that.
            I come up a lot of chalengese in my  life like I live in the contryside in Africa where I don't have access to school and in lak of even of getting a book I teach myselfe and I still learning any thing I want to learn,
            so the problem of my social skills and comfident it is just my next challenge.
            there is no better than learning in the field so lets learn directly in the field and get stronger after each battle.
